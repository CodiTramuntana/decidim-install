Basic configuration of Decidim
==============================

In this document, we'll finish the configuration of our installation of Decidim in order to make it capable of the most basic things, like sending emails. This configuration is independent of the operating system, that's why it's in a different file.

I'll assume here that you have a [running copy of Decidim](decidim-bionic.md) with empty content, no users or organizations created yet (a part from the system user admin created in the previous tutorial).
