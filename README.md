Installing Decidim
==================

A easy guide to install [Decidim](https://github.com/decidim/decidim), which is a participatory democracy framework created in Ruby on Rails.

It's a very interesting piece of software but it may be challenging to install it if you are not familiar with the internals.

Here I'll make a step-by-step guide on how to install it on production into a machine with Ubuntu 18.04.

I've made this guide because it can be quite challenging to install Decidim in production (as there's currently not much official documentation covering this). This guide also covers some common problems you may face during the process.

Start here:

1. [Installing Decidim on Ubuntu 18.04](decidim-bionic.md)
1. [Minimal configuration of Decidim](basic-config.md)

Feel free to create issues or pull requests if you encounter errors or want to make improvements in this guide!
